Understanding LVR is crucial for anyone participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) because it directly impacts the returns of liquidity providers (LPs). By exploring how LVR functions and how it can be measured, stakeholders will gain insights into the risks and rewards of liquidity provision, learn strategies to mitigate LVR, and discover how this knowledge can influence AMM design and fee structures in the future.
